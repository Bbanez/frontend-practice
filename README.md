## Task 1

Draw a red rectangle in the middle of the screen. When you click on the rectangle it should change color to green. If you click again, it should change color to blue and if you click again, it should switch back to red. This means that clicking on the rectangle it should loop through red, green and blue colors.

Rectangle should stay in the middle of the screen event if the window is resized.
